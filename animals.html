They are one of the only international humane societies in the world. Help animals by encouraging going vegan, cage free animals, and very against getting rid of animals in streets, harmful shelters, and animal abuse. You can donate or be a volunteer to help animals in need. We recommend this charity because we believe that animals are living and deserve to be treated decently.
