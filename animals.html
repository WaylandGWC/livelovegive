Help animals by encouraging going vegan, cage free animals, and very against getting rid of animals in streets, harmful shelters, and animal abuse. You can donate or be a volunteer to help animals in need. We recommend this charity because we believe that animals are living and deserve to be treated decently.

They were founded in 1866 by Henry Bergh.	The American society for the prevention of cruelty to animals was one of the first charities to help animals and are now one of the most well known worldwide. The headquarters of ASPCA is New York City. They have volunteers and employees who help heal injured animals, feed starving animals, and prevent any sort of cruelty. They are proud of their 2 million supporters all over the globe. Become one today!	You can donate, volunteer, and adopt an animal to help them out.	We are all for the support of helping animals and we believe that every animal deserves a safe, loving family and should never be harmed in any way.

WWF's goal is to protect nature and the animals that live in it. WWF help endangered, critically endangered, and non-endanged animals every day. WWF helps hundreds of animals live in the wild and won't stop until every animal is safe. WWF donates millions of dollars each year to animals in need and travel across the world in order to help them. You can donate online or adopt an animal in order to help save these species. We reccomend this organization because WWF has been helping animals for a long time and help so many of them each year.
