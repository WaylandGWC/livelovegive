  <a target="_blank" href= "https://perkins1.secure.force.com/pmtx/dn8n__SiteDonation?id=a0z3900006BSoO1">Perkins School for the Blind</a> is a famous school that helps blind children realize their potential. Some famous alumni are Helen Keller and Laura Bridgman, the first deafblind person to read. Perkins educates, trains and improves the lives of approximately 4.5 million children around the world, and provides multiple services and training programs for deaf or blind people. They also have a library with 530,000 items in braille, audio, electronic and large print formats that provide deafblind people with ways to read. You can donate to give Perkins money to provide more services and help more people, and you can volunteer at Perkins. We recommend this school because it is the oldest school for the blind in the US, and has helped many deafblind people become successful.
