 <p>
 Live Love Give is website made by a group of seventh and eighth grade girls in Wayland MA. We are passionate about coding and helping to make our community a better place. Donating to charity is something that is important and we believe is the right thing to do. We think that it is too hard to find reliable charities to contribute to and we want to change that. Live Love Give is an easy-to-use website that will help you find great charities to donate to! Our goal is to make this as easy as it can get. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please email us at the address below.
