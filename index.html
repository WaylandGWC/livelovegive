 Live Love Give's January Spotlight
 </h2>
 <p>
 Each month Live Love Give chooses a charities to be in the spotlight. This is a charity that has done a lot recently to help and we want everyone to know. This month's charity is Cradles to Crayons.  
 </p>
 <p>
 <a target="_blank" href= "https://www.cradlestocrayons.org/donate-now/"> Cradles to Crayons</a>  was founded in 2002 by  Lynn Margherio, after she noticed how many outgrown or even unworn clothes her niece had. Cradles to Crayons is a charity that gives essentials to disadvantaged children, that kids shouldn't have to go without. Cradles to Crayons has offices in Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia. They donate new clothes and new toys to kids in need. You can donate money, new clothes, new toys and books, and your time by volunteering at their warehouses. Live Love Give recommends this organization because they serve over 200,000 children every year, and we believe they have a big impact on our community, and many others.
