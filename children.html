  <a target="_blank" href="http://marisatufarofoundation.org/donate/">Marisa Tufaro Foundation.</a> Marisa Tufaro was born with a complex cardiac defect. When she tragically passed away at age 13 due to heart transplant complications, her family started a foundation to give back to Boston Children's, Philadelphia Children's, and many other places, to help children in need. MTF gives money for scholarships, to several hospitals, and many other organizations. Their main goal is to provide young medical patients with things that they want/need. You can donate and/or give gift cards or other gifts to help children. We recommend this charity because it is very important to give back, and one of our founder's families knew her personally.
