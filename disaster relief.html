  <a target="_blank" href= "https://www.redcross.org/donate/donation">American Red Cross</a>  helps people recovering from world and health diasters all across America. American Red Cross is a non profit organization that was founded by Clara Barton in order to help soldiers in the civil war. Overtime, this organization spread and started helping out people in or recovering from disasters all over the world. Clara was a nurse and a very powerful woman figure in a time when women weren't as powerful, and this sends a really good message about how women can start a powerful and successful organization. You can donate money in order to help with this organization or you can volenteer and help America along the 500,000 other volenteers that help with the many diasters each year. Live Love Give reccomends this charity because this organization helps so many people and are passionate about helping people all across America. Founded for an important and unforgetting purpose, the American Red Cross shows America that helping is always the right answer.
