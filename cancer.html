Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is an organization working to defeat cancer.  They provide children and adults with the best available cancer treatment and care, and research the newest technology to develop cures. You can help by contributing money to support cancer research and treatment, volunteering, or donating. We reccomend this charity because it helps a lot of people and has many awards including the Facility of the Year Award, a TurnKey Award from ALN Magazine, and a gold award by the New Hampshire Union Leader’s annual Readers’ Choice program.
