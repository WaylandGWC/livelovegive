 <a target="blank_" href="http://www.massgeneral.org/cancer/support/"> Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center</a> was founded to treat and fight cancer in 1986 by Kurt Isselbacher MD. The MGH Cancer Center is a section of the Massachusetts General Hospital that treats cancer and does lots of research to find a cure for cancer. They provide customized, innovative treatments to adults and children. You can donate money or do a fundraiser. We are supportive of MGH because one of our team members has lost loved ones due to cancer and we want to give back.
