The idea was inspired by events in the Great Depression when Kip's grandmother started distributing food during this dark age. Then in the 1970's and 1980's, Kip started distributing food in her station wagon to hungry people, and that is how GBFB started. GBFB donates food to people who can't afford it and helps people get back on their feet and keep them happy and healthy. Users can donate to GBFB and help every person and family, put food on their table. GBFB will get food for these people and change their lives for the better. Live Love Give recommends this organization because they help so many families/people each year fight hunger. They are also the largest food bank in New England and one of the largest food banks in the country.
