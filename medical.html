  <a target= "_blank" href = "http://www.ndss.org/donate/donate-to-ndss/">The National Down Syndrome Society</a> was founded in 1979 by Betsy Goodwin and Arden Moulton. Betsy's daughter Carson Goodwin was diagnosed with Down syndrome, and Betsy and her husband Barton realized how little resources are available to parents of children with Down syndrome.	NDSS promotes the value and acceptance of people with Down syndrome. They advocate for people with Down syndrome and help them be independent.	They do many things that benefit individuals with the disease. They hold events, fundraisers, and help people with Down syndrome get jobs and make lives for themselves. 	You can participate in NDSS events, and donate to help improve people's lives.	We recommend this organization because they are the leading human rights organization for all individuals with Down syndrome.
