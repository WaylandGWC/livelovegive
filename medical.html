   <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/" >Doctors Without Borders</a> Doctors Without Borders or Médecins Sans Frontières, started in May 1968, when a group of young doctors wanted to help during conflict in Paris. DWB provides healthcare to people who do not have access to hospitals or basic medical care. DWB helps people in war zones, after natural disasters, and during epidemics. You can donate money, you can volunteer, or you can fundraise for Doctors without Borders. Live Love Give recommends this organization because they provide care to thousands of people all over the world, and they change the lives of people without access to basic medical care.
