   <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/" >Doctors Without Borders</a> or Médecins Sans Frontières, started in May 1968, when a group of young doctors wanted to help during conflict in Paris. DWB provides healthcare to people who do not have access to hospitals or basic medical care. DWB helps people in war zones, after natural disasters, and during epidemics. You can donate money, you can volunteer, or you can fundraise for Doctors without Borders. Live Love Give recommends this organization because they provide care to thousands of people all over the world, and they change the lives of people without access to basic medical care.

 <a target= "_blank" href = "https://givenlimb.org/donate/">The Given Limb Foundation</a> was established in 2007 after Martha McDade's brother-in-law returned from Iraq and described the injuries and the difficult long-term care needed for an amputee. GLF is dedicated to improving the lives of amputees who have "given limbs" in service to our country. The Given Limb Foundation supports programs, services, and outreach to amputees, especially veterans. They also provide financial help with prosthetics.You can donate to fund current and future projects to change the lives of amputees.

  <a target= "_blank" href = "http://www.ndss.org/donate/donate-to-ndss/">The National Down Syndrome Society</a> was founded in 1979 by Betsy Goodwin and Arden Moulton. Betsy's daughter Carson Goodwin was diagnosed with Down syndrome, and Betsy and her husband Barton realized how little resources are available to parents of children with Down syndrome.	NDSS promotes the value and acceptance of people with Down syndrome. They advocate for people with Down syndrome and help them be independent.	They do many things that benefit individuals with the disease. They hold events, fundraisers, and help people with Down syndrome get jobs and make lives for themselves. 	You can participate in NDSS events, and donate to help improve people's lives.	We recommend this organization because they are the leading human rights organization for all individuals with Down syndrome.
